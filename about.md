I'm [Pablo Rodr√≠guez-Mier](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=o8v__F8AAAAJ&hl=es), postdoctoral research fellow at [CiTIUS](https://citius.usc.es/), in Santiago de Compostela. After graduating in Computer Science from the University of Santiago de Compostela, I remained in the Department of Electronics and Computer Science to study for a PhD in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI), just because I wanted to learn more about AI, but especially because I wanted to contribute to science, not only by writing research papers, but also by writing open-source code that can help other people accomplish their goals. And that's what I'm still trying to do.
